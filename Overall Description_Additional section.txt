2.2. System Environment
	
Both customers and companies access the website through internet from a particular URL. 
However, once accessed the website, companies should go to a section, designed specifically 
for them where they have to fill in a request form and after that waiting for approval before 
they can work with the organization. Customers on the other hand have to register but do not have 
to wait for approval from the organization.
