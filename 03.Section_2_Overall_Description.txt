2.0 Overall Description

2.1 Website purpose

The website aims towards two different types of clients. 
It cannot operate if either of those is not present. The first type, 
which we will simply call Customer, is using the website for personal use. 
The second type, which we choose to name Company Client, is using the website for business aims.

2.1.1 Customers

Customers can browse different categories and find offers which match their taste. 
After finding the desired offer customers can buy coupons with discounted prices. 
Customers have access to all coupon offers in the website and are able to choose from a big variety of offers. 
The only requirement for customers is to register.

2.1.2 Company Clients

Company clients are able to deliver their products to large customer audience which can be very beneficial for their business. 
They have to make an offer of a particular product or service which is then presented on the website and can be viewed from everyone 
(even from visitors which do not have registration) but accessed and purchased only by registered users. 
However, company clients should apply and be approved by the organization first. 
Otherwise their offer will not be displayed on the website.
